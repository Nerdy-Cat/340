How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
Including thorough comments and following best practices for even the smallest projects allows them to be built upon. This crud module could be used and adapted for other mongo projects I may do in the future.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
Approaching problems as a computer scientist involves breaking down complex tasks and finding efficient solutions. In this assignment we had a very solid outline for what to do, unlike other classes. In other classes I had to analyze transcripts of interviews to find what the client wants. I would use my database knowledge to efficiently organize and use data for future clients.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
Computer scientists create everything that has to do with computing. From an app to an OS to a factory machine program. Work from this class would help visualize data from databases and make efficient apps.
